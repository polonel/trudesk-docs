## Getting Started

Trudesk is built with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org), [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com), and [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/) which allows it to run in any cloud provider stack, VM, Docker, or bare metal.

Get started by **deploying an instance**.

## Deploying Instance
Quickly deploy a new instance with [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/download/server)

### What you'll need
- [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/download/server) 20.04 LTS
  - If installing MongoDB and ElasticSearch, a minium of **2GB** of memory and **5GB** of storage is required.

### Deploy with Ubuntu Install Script
Deploy Trudesk with a simple one-liner on a fresh install of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

:::note Recommended Options
It is **recommended** to select **Yes** to install **ElasticSerach** and  **MongoDB** when running the install script.
:::

```bash
curl -L -s https://storage.trudesk.io/install/ubuntu-1.2.sh
```

Once complete you can access your deployment at **http://{ipaddress}:8118**

### Other Notes
- In a production environment you should serve **Trudesk** over `https`. It is recommended to use an `nginx` reverse proxy with `ssl` in front of Trudesk.
Please read the [Nginx Reverse Proxy](http://localhost) documentation for more information.

:::caution Update Credentials before Production
Ubuntu install script is publically avaliable and thus the **username** and **password** used within MongoDB are designed for quick deployment for demo purposes. **Please read [Updating MongoDB Credentials](/)** before utilizing your instance in production.
:::

## Deploy with Docker-Compose
Within the Github repo, a sample `docker-compose.yml` file is included. We can quickly stand up a demo site with docker. 

**Download `docker-compose.yml` from Github repo**
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polonel/trudesk/master/docker-compose.yml
```
**Stand Up Docker Stack**
```bash
docker-compose up
```

Three containers are deployed; **MongoDB**, **ElasticSearch**, **Trudesk**. Once all containers are online, access the Trudesk instance at [http://localhost:8118](http://localhost:8118)

*Note: By default MongoDB and Elastic search ports are exposed to the host*

## What's Next
Once you finished the install wizard you'll be prompted to login. From here the first steps to any fresh deployment is to **configure Trudesk** for use.
Here are some recommended topics to get you started.
- Setup your [General](/) configuration.
- Get your [Mailer](/) up and running.
- Learn about [Department, Teams, & Groups](/).
- Customize your [Appearance](/).

## Something Not Right?
If you find issues with the documentation or have suggestions on how to improve the documentation please [file an issue](https://github.com/polonel/trudesk/issues) for us. The Community Edition of Trudesk is maintained by a very small team, so any additional support is welcomed with open arms.
